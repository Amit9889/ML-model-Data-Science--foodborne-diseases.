#I'll help you set up and run this analysis in VSCode. Here's a step-by-step guide:

First, let's create a proper project structure and ensure you have all requirements:

Project Setup RequirementsClick to open code
Here are the steps to run the analysis in VSCode:

Set Up Your Environment:
bashCopy# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir foodborne_analysis
cd foodborne_analysis

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Create requirements.txt and install dependencies
# Copy the contents from the requirements.txt artifact above
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create Your Python Files:

Create a new file called foodborne_analysis.py
Copy the code from the previous artifact into this file


Prepare Your Data:

Place your dataset CSV file in the project directory
Update the filepath in the code to match your CSV filename


Run in VSCode:

Open VSCode:
bashCopycode .

Install recommended Python extensions when prompted
Select your Python interpreter (the one from your virtual environment)
Modify the main section of the code to run directly:



Modified Main ScriptClick to open code

Running the Code:

Click the "Run" button in VSCode (top-right play button)
Or run from terminal:
bashCopypython foodborne_analysis.py



Debugging Tips:

Set breakpoints by clicking to the left of line numbers
Use VSCode's debug console to inspect variables
Use the integrated terminal to see print outputs


Common VSCode Shortcuts:

F5: Start debugging
Shift+F5: Stop debugging
F9: Toggle breakpoint
Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+P (Mac): Command palette


Recommended VSCode Settings:
Add these to your settings.json for better Python development:
jsonCopy{
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
    "python.formatting.provider": "autopep8",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic"
}


If you encounter any errors:

ModuleNotFoundError: Run pip install -r requirements.txt again
File not found: Check your file path and working directory
Plotting errors: Make sure you're running in an environment that can display plots
